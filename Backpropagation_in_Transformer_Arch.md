Backpropagation in Transformer Architectures: A Detailed Mathematical ExpositionThis report provides a comprehensive mathematical analysis of the backpropagation algorithm as applied to Transformer models. It begins by establishing the foundational principles of backpropagation, including the chain rule and gradient descent, and then systematically details the architecture of the Transformer. The core of the report focuses on the meticulous derivation of gradients for each key component of the Transformer, including embedding layers, positional encoding, multi-head attention, scaled dot-product attention, position-wise feed-forward networks, layer normalization, and residual connections. Finally, it synthesizes these elements to illustrate the end-to-end gradient flow within a complete Transformer layer and discusses considerations for practical implementation.I. Foundations of Backpropagation in Neural NetworksThe training of deep neural networks, including Transformers, relies fundamentally on the backpropagation algorithm to efficiently compute the gradients of a loss function with respect to the model's parameters. These gradients are then used by optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, to iteratively update the parameters and minimize the loss.A. The Chain Rule: The Mathematical Engine of LearningThe chain rule from calculus is the mathematical cornerstone of backpropagation.1 It allows for the computation of the derivative of a composite function. In the context of neural networks, the loss function L can be seen as a deeply nested composition of functions, where each function corresponds to an operation within a layer or an entire layer itself. If L=f(y1​,y2​,...,ym​) and each intermediate variable yi​ is a function of other variables, say yi​=gi​(x1​,x2​,...,xn​), the chain rule enables the calculation of the partial derivative of L with respect to any xj​ by summing the contributions through all intermediate yi​:$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_j} = \sum_i \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_i} \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial x_j} $$Backpropagation is an algorithm that systematically and efficiently applies this chain rule to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to all model parameters (weights and biases).1 It achieves efficiency by computing gradients layer by layer, iterating backward from the final loss output towards the initial input layer, thereby avoiding redundant calculations of intermediate gradient terms.1The process involves two key types of gradients:
Upstream Gradient: The gradient of the final loss function with respect to the output of a particular operation or layer. For an operation f producing output y, this is ∂y∂L​.
Local Gradient: The gradient of an operation's output with respect to its immediate inputs. For an operation y=f(x), the local gradient is ∂x∂y​.
The gradient of the loss function with respect to the input x of the operation f is then the product of the upstream gradient and the local gradient: ∂x∂L​=∂y∂L​∂x∂y​.3The application of the chain rule in this manner facilitates a modular design for gradient computation. A neural network can be conceptualized as a sequence of functions, L(fk​(...f2​(f1​(X,W1​))...),Wk​), where X represents the input data and Wi​ denotes the parameters of layer i. The chain rule dictates that the gradient with respect to parameters of an early layer, say W1​, is (\frac{dL}{dW_1} = \frac{dL}{df_k} \frac{df_k}{df_{k-1}} \dots \frac{df_2}{df_1} \frac{df_1}{dW_1}). Backpropagation systematically computes terms like (\frac{dL}{df_i}), which is the upstream gradient for layer i. This term is then used to calculate both the gradient for the parameters of layer i, (\frac{dL}{dW_i} = \frac{dL}{df_i} \frac{df_i}{dW_i}), and the upstream gradient for the preceding layer i−1, (\frac{dL}{df_{i-1}} = \frac{dL}{df_i} \frac{df_i}{df_{i-1}}). This recursive structure means that if the local derivatives (\frac{df_i}{dW_i}) (gradient with respect to parameters) and (\frac{df_i}{df_{i-1}}) (gradient with respect to input) are defined for each type of layer or operation, backpropagation can be constructed for any network composed of these elements. This principle is fundamental to automatic differentiation libraries and provides a clear roadmap for implementing backpropagation from scratch.B. Gradient Descent and Parameter OptimizationOnce backpropagation computes the gradients of the loss function L with respect to the model parameters, typically weights W and biases b, these gradients ((\frac{\partial L}{\partial W}) and (\frac{\partial L}{\partial b})) are utilized by an optimization algorithm to update the parameters.1 The most common optimization strategy is gradient descent, where parameters are adjusted in the direction opposite to their gradient. The basic update rule for a weight matrix W is:Wnew​=Wold​−η∂Wold​∂L​Here, η is the learning rate, a hyperparameter that controls the step size of the update.2 The objective is to iteratively refine the parameters to minimize the loss function, thereby improving the model's performance on the given task.4 It is important to distinguish that backpropagation is the algorithm for calculating these gradients, while an optimizer (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam) uses these gradients to perform the parameter updates.5 The seminal "Attention Is All You Need" paper, for instance, employed the Adam optimizer for training Transformer models.6Backpropagation serves as a critical information conduit for the optimization process. It distills the complex relationship between any individual parameter and the final scalar loss into a single gradient value (or vector/matrix of values for parameter vectors/matrices). The optimization algorithm then operates on these gradients without needing intrinsic knowledge of the network's architecture that produced them. The loss L is a function of numerous parameters. To optimize L, the sensitivity of L to changes in each parameter Wij​ (i.e., ∂Wij​∂L​) must be known. Backpropagation provides exactly these sensitivities. The optimizer, such as Adam, then takes these gradients and, potentially using its own internal state (like momentum terms or adaptive learning rate scaling), determines the precise update ΔWij​ to apply to the parameter. In this interaction, backpropagation acts as the interface that furnishes the optimizer with the necessary sensitivity information derived from the network's current state and the training data.C. Computation Graphs: Visualizing Gradient FlowNeural network operations can be effectively represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), often referred to as a computation graph.8 In this graph:
Nodes represent variables: inputs, parameters (weights, biases), intermediate values computed within the network, and the final loss value.
Edges represent the functions or operations that transform these variables (e.g., matrix multiplication, activation functions, normalization).
The forward pass through the network involves computing the value of each node in a topological order, starting from the input nodes and proceeding through intermediate operations until the final loss is calculated.8The backward pass, which is the core of backpropagation, traverses this graph in the reverse topological order.8 It begins at the loss node, where the gradient of the loss with respect to itself (∂L∂L​) is trivially 1. At each subsequent node, the chain rule is applied to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to that node's value, based on the gradients of the nodes that depend on it (its "children" in the forward graph, or "parents" in the backward flow). For a node vi​ in the computation graph, its gradient vˉi​=∂vi​∂L​ is calculated as the sum of contributions from all its children vj​:vˉi​=j∈Ch(vi​)∑​vˉj​∂vi​∂vj​​where Ch(vi​) denotes the set of children of vi​ (nodes whose values are computed using vi​).8A crucial aspect of implementing backpropagation efficiently is the caching of activations and other intermediate values computed during the forward pass.1 Many local gradient calculations require these forward-pass values. For instance, if an activation function is f(z), its derivative f′(z) often depends on z (the input to the activation) or f(z) (the output of the activation) itself. Storing these during the forward pass avoids recomputation during the backward pass.The use of computation graphs highlights backpropagation's efficiency, which can be understood as a form of dynamic programming. It systematically avoids redundant computations of shared intermediate gradients. Consider an intermediate variable z that is an input to multiple subsequent operations, for example, a=f(z) and b=g(z), where the overall loss L depends on both a and b. The gradient ∂z∂L​ receives contributions from both computational paths: ∂z∂L​=∂a∂L​∂z∂a​+∂b∂L​∂z∂b​. During the backward pass, (\frac{\partial L}{\partial a}) and (\frac{\partial L}{\partial b}) are computed first (as they are "downstream" from z with respect to the loss). When the backward pass reaches node z, its local derivatives (\frac{\partial a}{\partial z}) and (\frac{\partial b}{\partial z}) are computed. The calculation of (\frac{\partial L}{\partial z}) then reuses the already computed upstream gradients (\frac{\partial L}{\partial a}) and (\frac{\partial L}{\partial b}). This reuse is a key source of efficiency, particularly because these upstream gradients can themselves be complex terms derived from numerous subsequent operations.1II. The Transformer Architecture: A Backpropagation PerspectiveThe Transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), has revolutionized sequence processing tasks by relying entirely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions.6 Understanding its architecture is crucial before delving into the specifics of backpropagation through its components.A. Encoder-Decoder Framework and LayeringThe original Transformer model follows an encoder-decoder structure, particularly suited for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation.6
The encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1​,…,xn​) to a sequence of continuous representations z=(z1​,…,zn​).
The decoder then generates an output sequence (y1​,…,ym​) one element at a time, conditioned on z and previously generated symbols (auto-regressive behavior).10
Both the encoder and the decoder are composed of a stack of N identical layers. In the foundational "Attention Is All You Need" paper, N=6 is used for both the encoder and decoder stacks.10 The output of one layer becomes the input to the next, creating a deep computational pathway.The use of N identical layers in a stack implies that the mathematical structure of the gradient computations within each layer (for its parameters and for the gradient passed to the preceding layer) will be fundamentally similar. While the form of the equations remains consistent, the numerical values of the gradients will differ across layers. This is because the input activations fed into each layer and the upstream gradients received from the subsequent layer are unique to each layer's position in the stack. This architectural homogeneity simplifies implementation, as a single layer class can be instantiated multiple times. However, the depth introduced by stacking (e.g., N=6 or more in larger models) necessitates mechanisms like residual connections and layer normalization to ensure stable and effective gradient propagation across the entire network depth.12 Without these, deep networks are prone to issues like vanishing or exploding gradients, which hinder learning.B. Core Components and their Role in the Forward PassEach layer in the Transformer, whether in the encoder or decoder, is constructed from a set of core components. A brief overview of their forward pass functionality is essential for contextualizing the subsequent backpropagation derivations.1. Input Embedding & Positional Encoding
Input Embedding: Input sequences consist of tokens, which are typically integer indices representing words or sub-word units from a predefined vocabulary. The embedding layer converts these discrete tokens into continuous vector representations of dimension dmodel​ (e.g., dmodel​=512 in the base Transformer).11 This is usually implemented as a learnable lookup table, mathematically equivalent to multiplying a one-hot encoded token vector by an embedding weight matrix WE​∈RV×dmodel​, where V is the vocabulary size.15
Positional Encoding (PE): Since Transformers lack recurrent or convolutional structures that inherently process sequential order, information about the position of tokens within the sequence must be explicitly injected.16 This is achieved by adding positional encoding vectors to the token embeddings at the input of both the encoder and decoder stacks.11 These PE vectors have the same dimension dmodel​ as the embeddings. In the original Transformer, these are fixed (non-learnable) and are calculated using sine and cosine functions of varying frequencies:
PE(pos,2i)​=sin(pos/100002i/dmodel​) PE(pos,2i+1)​=cos(pos/100002i/dmodel​)
where pos is the position of the token in the sequence (0-indexed), and i is the dimension index (ranging from 0 to dmodel​/2−1).11 This formulation allows the model to learn to attend to relative positions.
2. Multi-Head Attention (MHA)Multi-Head Attention is a pivotal component, enabling the model to simultaneously attend to information from different representational subspaces at various positions.11An MHA module consists of h parallel "attention heads" (e.g., h=8 in the base Transformer).11 Each head performs Scaled Dot-Product Attention independently.The input to the MHA layer, typically the output from the previous layer X∈RT×dmodel​ (where T is sequence length), is linearly projected into Queries (Qi′​), Keys (Ki′​), and Values (Vi′​) for each head i using distinct weight matrices WiQ​∈Rdmodel​×dk​, WiK​∈Rdmodel​×dk​, and WiV​∈Rdmodel​×dv​.11So, Qi′​=XWiQ​, Ki′​=XWiK​, Vi′​=XWiV​.The dimensions dk​ and dv​ are typically set to dmodel​/h (e.g., 512/8=64).11The output of each attention head, headi​∈RT×dv​, is computed using Scaled Dot-Product Attention. These h outputs are then concatenated along the feature dimension, resulting in a matrix of shape RT×(h⋅dv​). This concatenated matrix is then linearly projected by another weight matrix WO∈R(h⋅dv​)×dmodel​ to produce the final MHA output, which has the dimension RT×dmodel​.11MultiHead(X)=Concat(head1​,…,headh​)WOwhere headi​=Attention(XWiQ​,XWiK​,XWiV​).There are different contexts for MHA in Transformers:
Encoder Self-Attention: Q, K, and V are all derived from the same source: the output of the previous encoder layer. This allows each position in the encoder to attend to all positions in the previous layer's output.10
Decoder Masked Self-Attention: Q, K, and V are derived from the same source: the output of the previous decoder layer. However, masking is applied to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions, preserving the auto-regressive property (i.e., the prediction for position j can only depend on known outputs at positions less than j).10
Encoder-Decoder Attention (Cross-Attention): This sub-layer exists only in the decoder. The Queries Q are derived from the output of the preceding masked self-attention sub-layer in the decoder. The Keys K and Values V are derived from the output of the encoder stack.10 This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence.
3. Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA)This is the core computation performed within each attention head.11 Given Query (Q∈RTq​×dk​), Key (K∈RTk​×dk​), and Value (V∈RTk​×dv​) matrices (here Tq​ is query sequence length, Tk​ is key/value sequence length), the output is computed as:Attention(Q,K,V)=softmax(dk​​QKT​)VLet S=QKT be the matrix of dot products (raw scores), S∈RTq​×Tk​.The scaling factor dk​​1​ is applied to these scores: Sscaled​=dk​​S​.18 This scaling is crucial because for large values of dk​, the dot products QKT can grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where its gradients are extremely small, thus hampering learning.The softmax function is applied row-wise to Sscaled​ to obtain the attention weights A=softmax(Sscaled​), where A∈RTq​×Tk​ and ∑j​Aij​=1 for each row i.The final output of the attention mechanism is Zattn​=AV, a weighted sum of the Value vectors, where Zattn​∈RTq​×dv​.4. Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks (FFN)Following the multi-head attention sub-layer in each encoder and decoder layer, there is a position-wise feed-forward network (FFN).11 This FFN is applied independently and identically to each position (i.e., each token's representation vector) in the sequence.It consists of two linear transformations with a non-linear activation function in between.11 The original Transformer paper uses the ReLU activation function 11, though other activations like GeLU are common in more recent models.For an input vector x∈Rdmodel​ (representing a single token), the FFN is defined as:FFN(x)=ReLU(xW1​+b1​)W2​+b2​where:
W1​∈Rdmodel​×dff​ and b1​∈Rdff​ are the weight matrix and bias vector for the first linear transformation.
W2​∈Rdff​×dmodel​ and b2​∈Rdmodel​ are for the second linear transformation.
The dimensionality of the inner layer, dff​, is typically larger than dmodel​ (e.g., dff​=2048 when dmodel​=512 in the base Transformer).11 This expansion-then-contraction structure allows the FFN to learn more complex transformations on a per-position basis. The FFN processes each token's representation from the attention sub-layer independently, adding further capacity for feature extraction.
5. Residual Connections & Layer Normalization ("Add & Norm")To facilitate the training of deep networks and mitigate issues like vanishing gradients, Transformers employ residual connections and layer normalization around each of the two main sub-layers (MHA and FFN) in both encoder and decoder layers.11If X is the input to a sub-layer (e.g., MHA or FFN), and Sublayer(X) is the function implemented by that sub-layer, the output of the "Add & Norm" component is:Output=LayerNorm(X+Dropout(Sublayer(X)))The dropout is applied to the output of the sub-layer during training for regularization.26
Residual Connection (Add): The output of the sub-layer, Sublayer(X), is added to its input X. This allows gradients to flow more directly through the network during backpropagation, as the gradient of the sum can pass through the identity path X.12
Layer Normalization (Norm): Layer normalization is applied to the sum X+Sublayer(X). It normalizes the activations across the features for each example in the layer independently of other examples in the batch.11 For an input vector h∈Rdmodel​ (which is X+Sublayer(X) for a given position):
The mean μ and variance σ2 are computed across the dmodel​ dimensions of h:
μ=dmodel​1​j=1∑dmodel​​hj​ σ2=dmodel​1​j=1∑dmodel​​(hj​−μ)2
The normalized output is then:
LayerNorm(h)=γ⊙σ2+ϵ​h−μ​+β
where γ∈Rdmodel​ (scale) and β∈Rdmodel​ (shift) are learnable parameters, and ϵ is a small constant (e.g., 10−5) for numerical stability.11 ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication.
6. Output Layer (e.g., Softmax for classification)After the final decoder layer, the output representations are typically passed through a linear transformation followed by a softmax function to produce a probability distribution over the target vocabulary.23If Zfinal_decoder​∈RT×dmodel​ is the output from the top decoder layer, it is projected by a weight matrix Wout​∈Rdmodel​×Vtarget​ (where Vtarget​ is the target vocabulary size):Logits=Zfinal_decoder​Wout​Often, the bias term is omitted here, or Wout​ can be the transpose of the target embedding matrix (weight tying).23The probabilities are then computed using softmax:P(yt​∣y<t​,z)=softmax(Logitst​)where Logitst​ is the row of Logits corresponding to the t-th target token. The loss function (e.g., cross-entropy) is then computed based on these probabilities and the true target tokens.III. Backpropagation Through Transformer Components: Detailed MathematicsThis section provides detailed mathematical derivations for the backpropagation algorithm through each key component of the Transformer model. We denote the scalar loss function as L. The goal is to compute the partial derivatives of L with respect to the parameters of each component and with respect to its inputs, which are then passed to the preceding component. We assume the upstream gradient (gradient of the loss with respect to the output of the current component) is known.A. Backpropagation Through the Embedding LayerThe embedding layer maps input token IDs to dense vector representations.1. Mathematical Formulation of the Embedding LayerLet Xids​∈RT be a sequence of T token IDs (integers). Let WE​∈RV×dmodel​ be the embedding matrix, where V is the vocabulary size and dmodel​ is the embedding dimension. The output of the embedding layer, Xemb​∈RT×dmodel​, is obtained by looking up the corresponding row in WE​ for each token ID in Xids​.For a single token ID xidi​​ at position i, its embedding is Xemb​[i,:]=WE​[xidi​​,:]. This can also be represented by multiplying WET​ with a one-hot vector for xidi​​.152. Gradient Calculation for Embedding Weights (∂WE​∂L​)Let ∂Xemb​∂L​∈RT×dmodel​ be the gradient of the loss with respect to the output embeddings. This gradient is passed down from the subsequent layer (e.g., the addition with positional encodings).The embedding WE​[v,:] (row v of WE​) contributes to Xemb​[i,:] if the input token ID at position i, Xids​[i], is equal to v.Therefore, the gradient ∂WE​[v,d]∂L​ for a specific element of the embedding matrix (word v, dimension d) is the sum of the gradients ∂Xemb​[i,d]∂L​ for all positions i where the input token ID Xids​[i] was v:$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial W_E[v,d]} = \sum_{i=1}^{T} \mathbb{I}(X_{ids}[i] = v) \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial X_{emb}[i,d]} $$where I(⋅) is the indicator function. In practice, this means that for each token Xids​[i] in the input sequence, its corresponding gradient vector ∂Xemb​[i,:]∂L​ is added to the gradient of the Xids​[i]-th row of WE​. This is often implemented as a sparse update or an indexed add operation.3. Gradient Calculation for Input to Embedding Layer (∂Xids​∂L​)Since Xids​ consists of discrete integer token IDs, gradients are not typically propagated back to Xids​ in the same way as continuous variables. The embedding matrix WE​ contains the learnable parameters at this stage. If Xids​ were itself an output of some differentiable process (which is not the case for raw input tokens), then further backpropagation would be needed. For standard input token IDs, this step is not applicable for parameter updates.B. Backpropagation Through Positional Encoding1. Nature of Positional Encodings (Fixed vs. Learned)In the original Transformer model, positional encodings (PE) are fixed and calculated using sine and cosine functions.11 They are not learnable parameters.Xfinal_emb​=Xemb​+PEwhere Xemb​ is the output from the embedding layer, and PE∈RT×dmodel​ is the matrix of positional encodings.2. Gradient Flow (No learnable parameters in fixed PE)Let ∂Xfinal_emb​∂L​ be the gradient of the loss with respect to the sum of token embeddings and positional encodings.Since the addition operation is element-wise, the gradient distributes:$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial X_{emb}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial X_{final_emb}} \cdot \frac{\partial X_{final_emb}}{\partial X_{emb}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial X_{final_emb}} \cdot 1 = \frac{\partial L}{\partial X_{final_emb}} $$$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial PE} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial X_{final_emb}} \cdot \frac{\partial X_{final_emb}}{\partial PE} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial X_{final_emb}} \cdot 1 = \frac{\partial L}{\partial X_{final_emb}} $$As PE is fixed and not a learnable parameter, ∂PE∂L​ is computed but not used to update any parameters associated with PE itself.17 The relevant gradient that is propagated further backward is ∂Xemb​∂L​, which flows into the embedding layer.C. Backpropagation Through Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA)The Scaled Dot-Product Attention is a core component within each attention head.1. Forward Pass Equations (Recap)Given Query Q∈RTq​×dk​, Key K∈RTk​×dk​, and Value V∈RTk​×dv​.Let sdk​​=dk​​ be the scaling factor.
Scores: S=QKT∈RTq​×Tk​
Scaled Scores: Sscaled​=sdk​​S​
Attention Weights (Probabilities): A=softmax(Sscaled​)∈RTq​×Tk​ (softmax applied row-wise)
Output: Zattn​=AV∈RTq​×dv​
2. Gradient of the Loss with respect to the SDPA Output (∂Zattn​∂L​)This gradient is provided from the subsequent component (e.g., concatenation in MHA or the Add & Norm layer). Let this be denoted as dZattn​.3. Gradient with respect to Values (∂V∂L​)Using Zattn​=AV:$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial V} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial Z_{attn}} \frac{\partial Z_{attn}}{\partial V} = A^T dZ_{attn} $$So, dV=ATdZattn​. dV∈RTk​×dv​.4. Gradient with respect to Attention Scores (Softmax Output) (∂A∂L​)Using Zattn​=AV:$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial A} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial Z_{attn}} \frac{\partial Z_{attn}}{\partial A} = dZ_{attn} V^T $$So, dA=dZattn​VT. dA∈RTq​×Tk​.5. Gradient with respect to Pre-Softmax Scaled Scores (∂Sscaled​∂L​)Let A=softmax(Sscaled​). The derivative of the softmax function is more involved. If Ai​=softmax(Sscaled,i​) for row i, then ∂Sscaled,ik​∂Aij​​=Aij​(δjk​−Aik​).The gradient dSscaled​ can be computed element-wise for each row. For a single row sscaled​ of Sscaled​ and corresponding row a of A, and incoming gradient da (row of dA):$$ dS_{scaled, ij} = \sum_k dA_{ik} \frac{\partial A_{ik}}{\partial S_{scaled, ij}} = \sum_k dA_{ik} (A_{ij}(\delta_{jk} - A_{ik})) $$This can be written more compactly. For each row i of A and Sscaled​, let dAi​ be the i-th row of dA.dSscaled,i​=(dAi​−sum(dAi​⊙Ai​))⊙Ai​Alternatively, and more commonly for backpropagation through softmax combined with a loss like cross-entropy, the gradient ∂Sscaled​∂L​ (denoted dSscaled​) is often computed as A−Ytrue​ if A is the direct input to a cross-entropy loss with one-hot targets Ytrue​. Here, A is an intermediate output, so we use the chain rule with dA.For each row i:Let Sscaled,i​ be the i-th row of Sscaled​ and Ai​ be the i-th row of A.The Jacobian of Ai​ w.r.t Sscaled,i​ is Ji​=diag(Ai​)−AiT​Ai​.Then dSscaled,iT​=JiT​dAiT​. So, dSscaled,i​=dAi​Ji​.This can be computed as:dSscaled​=(dA−(dA⊙A)1Tk​T​A)⊙AA simpler way often cited for dSscaled​=∂Sscaled​∂L​ given dA=∂A∂L​ where A=softmax(Sscaled​) is:For each row i:dSscaled​[i,j]=p∑​dA[i,p]A[i,j](δjp​−A[i,p])This can be written in matrix form. For each row i of A (denoted Ai​) and Sscaled​ (denoted Sscaled,i​), and the corresponding row dAi​ of dA:dSscaled,i​=Ai​⊙(dAi​−(dAi​⋅Ai​)1Tk​T​)where ⋅ is dot product and 1Tk​​ is a row vector of ones of length Tk​.More directly, if Aj​=softmax(Sscaled,j​) for row j:$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial S_{scaled,jk}} = \sum_p \frac{\partial L}{\partial A_{jp}} \frac{\partial A_{jp}}{\partial S_{scaled,jk}} = \sum_p dA_{jp} A_{jp}(\delta_{pk} - A_{jk}) = dA_{jk}A_{jk} - A_{jk}\sum_p dA_{jp}A_{jp} $$So, dSscaled​=A⊙(dA−rowsum(dA⊙A)⋅11×Tk​​).Let's denote the gradient of the loss L with respect to the softmax input Sscaled​ as dSscaled​.For each row i, let Ai​ be the i-th row of A (output of softmax) and dAi​ be the i-th row of ∂A∂L​.Then, the i-th row of dSscaled​ is given by:dSscaled,i​=Ai​⊙(dAi​−(dAi​⋅AiT​)11×Tk​​)where ⊙ is element-wise multiplication, and 11×Tk​​ is a row vector of ones. This can be computed for all rows.A common expression for ∂Sscaled,ij​∂L​ (element i,j of Sscaled​) is:$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial S_{scaled,ij}} = \sum_k \frac{\partial L}{\partial A_{ik}} \frac{\partial A_{ik}}{\partial S_{scaled,ij}} = \sum_k dA_{ik} A_{ik}(\delta_{kj} - A_{ij}) = dA_{ij}A_{ij} - A_{ij}\sum_k dA_{ik}A_{ik} $$So, dSscaled​=A⊙(dA−diag(rowsum(dA⊙A))A), where rowsum(M) produces a column vector of row sums, and this is then broadcast or formed into a matrix that repeats the sum for each element in the row.A more standard form for softmax derivative: If A=softmax(Sscaled​), then ∂Sscaled​∂L​=(A−Ytarget​) if A is the final output and L is cross-entropy. Here, A is intermediate.The Jacobian of Ai​ (row i of A) w.r.t. Sscaled,i​ (row i of Sscaled​) is JSscaled,i​​(Ai​)=diag(Ai​)−Ai​AiT​.Then dSscaled,iT​=JSscaled,i​​(Ai​)TdAiT​. So dSscaled,i​=dAi​JSscaled,i​​(Ai​).dSscaled​=A⊙(dA−sum(dA⊙A,axis=1, keepdims=True)). This is a common way to write it.6. Gradient with respect to Unscaled Scores (∂S∂L​)Using Sscaled​=S/sdk​​:$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial S} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial S_{scaled}} \frac{\partial S_{scaled}}{\partial S} = dS_{scaled} \cdot \frac{1}{s_{d_k}} $$So, dS=sdk​​dSscaled​​.7. Gradient with respect to Keys (∂K∂L​)Using S=QKT:∂K∂L​=∂S∂L​∂K∂S​=dSTQSo, dK=dSTQ. dK∈RTk​×dk​. (Note: ∂K∂(QKT)​=Q. So ∂K∂L​=∂(QKT)∂L​Q. If S=QKT, dS=∂S∂L​, then dK=QTdS. No, this is incorrect. If f(X)=AXB, df/dX=AT(df/d(AXB))BT. Here S=QKT. dS/dK=Q. So dL/dK=(dL/dS)TQ. Let's verify: Sij​=∑p​Qip​Kjp​. ∂Kab​∂Sij​​=Qia​ if j=a,p=b.∂Kab​∂L​=∑i,j​∂Sij​∂L​∂Kab​∂Sij​​=∑i​∂Sia​∂L​Qib​.So dKab​=∑i​dSia​Qib​=(QTdS)ab​. This implies dK=QTdS.8. Gradient with respect to Queries (∂Q∂L​)Using S=QKT:∂Q∂L​=∂S∂L​∂Q∂S​=dSKSo, dQ=dSK. dQ∈RTq​×dk​.D. Backpropagation Through Multi-Head Attention (MHA)MHA involves multiple SDPA heads, linear projections, and a final concatenation and projection.1. Forward Pass Equations (Recap)Input X∈RT×dmodel​.Projection weights: WiQ​,WiK​∈Rdmodel​×dk​, WiV​∈Rdmodel​×dv​ for each head i=1…h.Output projection weight: WO∈R(h⋅dv​)×dmodel​.dk​=dv​=dhead​=dmodel​/h.For each head i:Qi​=XWiQ​, Ki​=XWiK​, Vi​=XWiV​headi​=Attention(Qi​,Ki​,Vi​) (using SDPA as defined above)Concatenated heads: Zconcat​=Concat(head1​,…,headh​)∈RT×(h⋅dv​)Final MHA Output: ZMHA​=Zconcat​WO∈RT×dmodel​2.

Distributing Gradients to Individual Heads (∂headi​∂L​)Zconcat​ is formed by concatenating head1​,…,headh​ along the feature dimension. The gradient dZconcat​ can be split accordingly to get dheadi​∈RT×dv​ for each head.If Zconcat​=[head1​∣head2​∣…∣headh​], then dheadi​ is the slice of dZconcat​ corresponding to headi​.dheadi​=dZconcat​[:,(i−1)dv​:i⋅dv​] (using Python-like slicing).6. Gradient with respect to Individual Head Projections (∂Qi​∂L​,∂Ki​∂L​,∂Vi​∂L​)For each head i, dheadi​ is ∂Zattn​∂L​ for that head's SDPA. We can use the SDPA backpropagation rules derived in III.C:
dVi​=AiT​dheadi​
dAi​=dheadi​ViT​
dSscaled,i​=softmax_backward(dAi​,Ai​) (using the row-wise softmax backward function from III.C.5)
dSi​=dSscaled,i​/sdk​​

A1​=ReLU(Z1​)∈RT×dff​
YFFN​=Z2​=A1​W2​+1b2T​∈RT×dmodel​ (output, b2​∈Rdmodel​)
The original paper uses max(0,xW1​+b1​)W2​+b2​ 11, implying biases are added after matrix multiplication for each position. If XFFN​ is a single row vector x, then z1​=xW1​+b1​, a1​=ReLU(z1​), yFFN​=a1​W2​+b2​. This is applied position-wise.

The derivative of ReLU is ReLU′(z)=1 if z>0, and 0 otherwise.dZ1​=dA1​⊙ReLU′(Z1​)where ⊙ is element-wise multiplication. ReLU′(Z1​) is a matrix of 0s and 1s based on the sign of elements in Z1​ (cached from forward pass).6.

Gradient with respect to Scale (γ) and Shift (β) Parameters (∂γ∂L​,∂β∂L​)$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \beta_i} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial Y_{LN,i}} \frac{\partial Y_{LN,i}}{\partial \beta_i} = dY_{LN,i} \cdot 1 $$So, dβ=dYLN​ (element-wise if dYLN​ is for a single instance, sum over batch if applicable).$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \gamma_i} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial Y_{LN,i}} \frac{\partial Y_{LN,i}}{\partial \gamma_i} = dY_{LN,i} \cdot \hat{X}_{LN,i} $$So, dγ=dYLN​⊙X^LN​.3. Gradient with respect to Normalized Input (∂X^LN​∂L​)$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{X}{LN,i}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial Y{LN,i}} \frac{\partial Y_{LN,i}}{\partial \hat{X}{LN,i}} = dY{LN,i} \cdot \gamma_i $$So, dX^LN​=dYLN​⊙γ.4. Gradient with respect to Variance (∂σ2∂L​)Let s=σ2+ϵ​. Then X^LN,i​=(XLN,i​−μ)s−1.$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \sigma^2} = \sum_i \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{X}{LN,i}} \frac{\partial \hat{X}{LN,i}}{\partial \sigma^2} = \sum_i d\hat{X}{LN,i} (X{LN,i} - \mu) (-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma^2+\epsilon)^{-3/2}) $$So, dσ2=∑i​dX^LN,i​⋅(XLN,i​−μ)⋅(−21​(s2)−3/2)=−2s31​∑i​dX^LN,i​(XLN,i​−μ).This is dσ2=sum(dX^LN​⊙(XLN​−μ))⋅2(σ2+ϵ)3/2−1​..29305.

Gradient with respect to LayerNorm Input (∂XLN​∂L​)For a specific input XLN,k​:$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial X_{LN,k}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{X}{LN,k}} \frac{\partial \hat{X}{LN,k}}{\partial X_{LN,k}} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mu} \frac{\partial \mu}{\partial X_{LN,k}} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \sigma^2} \frac{\partial \sigma^2}{\partial X_{LN,k}} $$
∂XLN,k​∂X^LN,k​​=s−1 (since μ and σ2 are treated as constants when differentiating X^LN,k​ w.r.t XLN,k​ for this specific term in the sum for X^LN,k​).
∂XLN,k​∂μ​=D1​.
∂XLN,k​∂σ2​=D2(XLN,k​−μ)​.
Substituting these:$dXLN,k​=dX^LN,k​s1​+dμD1​+dσ2D2(XLN,k​−μ)​Thiscanbewritteninvectorform[30,31][30,31]:$ dX_{LN} = \frac{1}{s} \left( d\hat{X}{LN} - \frac{1}{D}\text{sum}(d\hat{X}{LN}) - \hat{X}{LN} \odot \frac{1}{D}\text{sum}(d\hat{X}{LN} \odot \hat{X}_{LN}) \right) $$This is a standard result for LayerNorm/BatchNorm backward pass for input X.G. Backpropagation Through Residual Connections ("Add" operation)The residual connection is Y=Xinput​+Sublayer(Xinput​). Let Xs​=Sublayer(Xinput​). So Y=Xinput​+Xs​.1. Forward Pass: Y=Xinput​+Xs​2. Gradient Flow:Let dY=∂Y∂L​ be the upstream gradient.The gradient of an addition operation distributes to its inputs 3:$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial X_{input}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial Y} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial X_{input}} = dY \cdot 1 = dY $$$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial X_s} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial Y} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial X_s} = dY \cdot 1 = dY $$So, $dX_{input, \text{from_add}} = dY$ and dXs​=dY.The gradient dXs​ is then backpropagated into the Sublayer. The gradient $dX_{input, \text{from_add}}$ is added to any other gradient contributions to Xinput​ (e.g., if Xinput​ was also an input to the Sublayer, as is typical). The total gradient for Xinput​ would be $dY + \frac{\partial L}{\partial X_{input, \text{from_sublayer}}}$.H. Backpropagation Through the Output Layer (Softmax and Cross-Entropy Loss Example)Typically, the output layer of a Transformer for classification tasks (like machine translation, where each token is a class) uses a linear layer to produce logits, followed by a softmax function, and then a cross-entropy loss is computed.1. Forward Pass Equations (Recap)Let Zfinal​∈RT×dmodel​ be the output from the final decoder layer.Logits: logits=Zfinal​Wout​+bout​∈RT×Vtarget​ (where Vtarget​ is target vocabulary size).Probabilities (per position): Pt​=softmax(logitst​)∈RVtarget​.Loss (e.g., Negative Log Likelihood for a target token yt​ which is one-hot encoded):Lt​=−∑j​yt,j​logPt,j​=−logPt,ytrue_idx​​.The total loss L is often the sum or average of Lt​ over the sequence and batch.2. Combined Gradient of Softmax and Cross-Entropy Loss (∂logits∂L​)It is well-known that for a softmax activation followed by a cross-entropy loss, the gradient of the loss Lt​ with respect to the input to the softmax (the logits logitst​) has a very simple form 2727:$∂logitst,k​∂Lt​​=Pt,k​−yt,k​$In vector form for position t:∂logitst​∂Lt​​=Pt​−yt​where Pt​ is the vector of predicted probabilities and yt​ is the one-hot encoded true label vector for that position.This gradient dlogitst​ is then used to compute gradients for Wout​, bout​, and Zfinal​.dWout​=ZfinalT​dlogitsdbout​=sum(dlogits,axis=0)dZfinal​=dlogitsWoutT​These gradients are then propagated further back into the network.IV. Connecting the Dots: Backpropagation Across an Entire Transformer LayerA standard Transformer layer, in both the encoder and decoder, consists of a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism followed by a position-wise feed-forward network (FFN). Each of these sub-layers is wrapped with a residual connection and layer normalization ("Add & Norm").11 The number of such identical layers stacked is typically N=6 for the base model.10The connection between the FFN and the attention network is sequential within each layer: the output of the MHA sub-layer (after its "Add & Norm") serves as the input to the FFN sub-layer (which also has its "Add & Norm").Let X(l−1) be the input to layer l.A. Tracing Gradient Flow in an Encoder LayerAn encoder layer performs the following forward operations:
XMHA_in​=X(l−1)
YMHA​=MultiHeadAttention(XMHA_in​)
XNorm1_in​=XMHA_in​+Dropout(YMHA​)
XFFN_in​=LayerNorm(XNorm1_in​)
YFFN​=FeedForwardNetwork(XFFN_in​)
XNorm2_in​=XFFN_in​+Dropout(YFFN​)
X(l)=LayerNorm(XNorm2_in​) (Output of layer l)
Backpropagation proceeds in reverse:
Gradient from Layer l+1: Receive ∂X(l)∂L​. Let this be dX(l).

B. Tracing Gradient Flow in a Decoder LayerA decoder layer has three sub-layers: Masked MHA, Encoder-Decoder MHA, and FFN.
XMaskedMHA_in​=Xdecoder(l−1)​ (output of previous decoder layer, or target embeddings)
YMaskedMHA​=MaskedMultiHeadAttention(XMaskedMHA_in​)
XNorm1_in​=XMaskedMHA_in​+Dropout(YMaskedMHA​)
XEncDecMHA_in​=LayerNorm(XNorm1_in​)
Kenc​,Venc​ come from Encoder output Zencoder​.
YEncDecMHA​=MultiHeadAttention(Q=XEncDecMHA_in​,K=Kenc​,V=Venc​)
XNorm2_in​=XEncDecMHA_in​+Dropout(YEncDecMHA​)
XFFN_in​=LayerNorm(XNorm2_in​)
YFFN​=FeedForwardNetwork(XFFN_in​)
XNorm3_in​=XFFN_in​+Dropout(YFFN​)
Xdecoder(l)​=LayerNorm(XNorm3_in​) (Output of decoder layer l)
Backpropagation proceeds similarly, but with an additional MHA stage:
Receive dXdecoder(l)​.
Backprop through LayerNorm3, Add3, FFN (computing FFN param grads, dXFFN_in_total​).
Backprop through LayerNorm2 (input XNorm2_in​, upstream dXFFN_in_total​, output dXNorm2_in​).

Compute ∂XEncDecMHA_in​∂L​ (let this be dXEncDecMHA_in,from_EncDecMHA​).
Compute ∂Kenc​∂L​ and ∂Venc​∂L​. These gradients are propagated to the Encoder's output. This is a key point: gradients from the decoder flow back to the encoder parameters through this cross-attention mechanism.


The total gradient for XEncDecMHA_in​ (output of LayerNorm1) is dXNorm2_in​+dXEncDecMHA_in,from_EncDecMHA​. Let this be dXEncDecMHA_in_total​.

Gradient to Decoder Layer l−1: The total gradient for Xdecoder(l−1)​ is dXNorm1_in​+dXMaskedMHA_in,from_MaskedMHA​.
C. The Role of Cached Activations in the Backward PassThroughout the backward pass, various values computed during the forward pass must be available.1 These include:
Inputs to layers/sub-layers (e.g., XMHA_in​,XFFN_in​).
Intermediate activations within sub-layers (e.g., Q,K,V matrices in attention, Z1​ before ReLU in FFN).
Outputs of functions whose derivatives depend on the output (e.g., A=softmax(Sscaled​), where dSscaled​ depends on A).
Statistics for normalization layers (mean μ, variance σ2 for LayerNorm).
Efficiently caching and retrieving these values is crucial for a correct and performant backpropagation implementation.
V. Implementation Considerations for NumPyImplementing backpropagation for Transformers from scratch in NumPy requires careful attention to matrix operations, gradient management, and numerical stability.A. Managing Matrix and Tensor Operations
Dimensionality: NumPy arrays must be handled with strict attention to their dimensions (1D vectors, 2D matrices, 3D+ tensors for batches/heads). Operations like np.dot, @ (for matrix multiplication), np.sum(axis=...), np.mean(axis=...), np.transpose(), and element-wise operations (*, +, -, /) are fundamental.
Broadcasting: NumPy's broadcasting rules can simplify operations (e.g., adding a bias vector to each row of a matrix), but their effect on gradient calculations must be understood (e.g., gradients for broadcasted variables need to be summed appropriately).
Forward Pass Caching: A mechanism to store all necessary intermediate activations and values from the forward pass is essential for the backward pass. This could be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary stores relevant tensors for a given layer or operation.
B. Gradient Checking and Debugging Strategies
Numerical Gradient Checking: Compare the analytically derived gradients with numerically approximated gradients. For a parameter θ and loss L:
$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \approx \frac{L(\theta + \epsilon) - L(\theta - \epsilon)}{2\epsilon} $$
This is computationally expensive but invaluable for verifying the correctness of backpropagation code for small sub-modules or the entire network on tiny data.
Shape Checking: Ensure that the shapes of gradients match the shapes of the corresponding parameters and activations at each step.
Initialization: Proper weight initialization (e.g., Xavier/Glorot, He initialization) is crucial to prevent exploding/vanishing activations and gradients early in training.12
Small Test Cases: Debug with very small sequences, vocabulary, dmodel​, and batch sizes to isolate issues.
C. Memory Management for Large Models
Transformers can be memory-intensive due to the storage of activations for the backward pass, especially with long sequences and large batch sizes.
While NumPy itself doesn't have built-in GPU acceleration like PyTorch or TensorFlow, careful implementation can optimize CPU usage. For very large models, techniques like gradient checkpointing (recomputing parts of the forward pass during backward pass to save memory) might be considered, though this adds complexity. However, for a from-scratch NumPy implementation, managing memory for activations is a primary concern. One might need to process data in smaller batches or use techniques to reduce the precision of stored activations if memory becomes a bottleneck.
VI. ConclusionBackpropagation in Transformer models, while intricate, is a systematic application of the chain rule through its various architectural components. The core mechanisms of self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks, combined with residual connections and layer normalization, each have well-defined forward and backward passes. The encoder processes the input sequence, building rich representations, while the decoder auto-regressively generates the output sequence, attending to both its own previous outputs and the encoder's representations.The detailed mathematical derivations for each component—embedding, positional encoding, scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, layer normalization, and residual connections—provide the necessary formulas to compute gradients with respect to all learnable parameters and intermediate activations. These gradients are essential for training Transformers using optimization algorithms like Adam. The flow of gradients across entire encoder and decoder layers, including the crucial gradient pathway from the decoder back to the encoder via cross-attention, underpins the model's ability to learn complex sequence-to-sequence mappings.Implementing these derivations from scratch, for instance in NumPy, requires meticulous attention to matrix calculus, careful management of tensor shapes and operations, and robust strategies for caching forward pass values and debugging gradient computations. While challenging, such an endeavor offers unparalleled insight into the inner workings of one of the most influential architectures in modern artificial intelligence. The principles outlined in this report form the basis for understanding and developing advanced sequence processing models.
